# Signalfarm

> Grow the signal. Kill the noise.

**Signalfarm** is an open source tool that helps you identify which things provide real value—and which are just noise.

It started with tests. Millions of them are run every day that always pass, never fail, and rarely provide insight. They're a false sense of safety—and a real source of waste. Signalfarm tracks outcomes over time and surfaces which executions (tests, jobs, events) are providing signal, and which ones you could stop running entirely.

## What It Does

- Ingests historical execution data (test runs, events, tasks, etc.)
- Analyzes patterns to detect low-signal or redundant activity
- Flags items that can be retired, trimmed, or deprioritized
- Surfaces high-signal failures or rare-but-useful outcomes
- Provides recommendations to optimize execution effort

## Why Use It

- Reduce CI/CD run times and costs
- Cut through noisy data in observability pipelines
- Focus team attention on what actually moves the needle
- Build a leaner, smarter operating rhythm

## Who It's For

- Engineers managing large test suites
- SREs and platform teams trying to cut noise
- Product ops or analytics teams overwhelmed by low-value events
- Anyone drowning in pass/fail logs with no clarity on impact
